# R and RStudio ...

# R is ...

* __Free__ to use

* __Extensible__: Over 12000 user contributed add-on packages currently on CRAN!

* __Powerful__: With the right tools, get more work done, faster.

* __Flexible__: Not a question of _can_, but _how_.

* __Frustrating__: Flexibility comes at a cost (easy to shoot yourself in the foot!).

```{r eval=FALSE}

# RStudio is ... 

[From Julie Lowndes](http://jules32.github.io/resources/RStudio_intro/):  


> If R were an airplane, RStudio would be the airport</b>, providing many, many supporting services that make it easier for you, the pilot, to take off and go to awesome places. Sure, you can fly an airplane without an airport, but having those runways and supporting infrastructure is a game-changer.

# The RStudio IDE


1. **Source editor:** Docking station for multiple files, Useful shortcuts ("Knit"), Highlighting/Tab-completion, Code-checking (R, HTML, JS), Debugging features  

2. **Console window:** Highlighting/Tab-completion, Search recent commands

3. **Environment pane:** Tools for package development, git, etc

4. **Other tabs/panes:** Graphics, R documentation, File system navigation/access

<p class = "note">
*Protip:* save yourself the headaches figuring out file paths and instead work in an RStudio R project (popup menu at the top left)

# The Happy Data 

The General Social Survey (GSS) has been run by NORC every other year since 1972 to keep track of current opinions across the United States. 

The package `ggmosaic` contains a subset of this data, called `happy`.
You can access the data using the command

```{r}
data(happy, package="ggmosaic")
# try to find out more on the data by typing ?happy
head(happy)
```

---

# R packages

Packages provide additional functionality in R. 

Packages have to be activated each time you use R.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

# drawing a barchart 

Univariate distribution: overall happiness levels

```{r}
ggplot(data = happy, aes(x = happy)) + geom_bar()
```


---
class: inverse
# Your Turn

Did as many men as women answer the survey?

Draw another barchart. 

---

# Convert `happy` to a score

```{r, warning = FALSE}
happy <- happy %>% mutate(
  happy = as.numeric(happy)
)

ggplot(data = happy, aes(x = happy)) + geom_bar()
```


---

# Some data managing functions

`summarize`

```{r}
happy %>% 
  summarize(
    mean = mean(happy, na.rm=TRUE)
  )
```


---

# Some data managing functions (2)

`group_by`

```{r}
happy %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(
    mean = mean(happy, na.rm=TRUE)
  )
```

combination of `group_by` and  `summarize` allow us to create summary statistics


---
class: inverse
# Your Turn

Compute average happiness level of respondents by age (`group_by(age)`)


---

# Visualizing happiness by age and gender

```{r, fig.width = 8, warning = FALSE}
happy %>% group_by(age, sex) %>%
  summarise(happy = mean(happy, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes( x = age, y = happy, colour = sex)) +
  geom_point()
```

# Your Turn

are people now happier than ten years ago? How is happiness related to time?

# Your Turn

What other aspects of the `happy` data are associated with happiness?
