# Factors

- A special type of variable to indicate categories

- both *labels* and their *order* (i.e. numbers) 

- By default text variables are stored in factors during input

- numeric categorical variables have to be converted to factors manually

- `factor` creates a new factor with specified labels

# Your Turn 

- Inspect the `fbi` object. How many variables are there? Which type does each of the variables have?

- Make a summary of Year

- Make Year  a factor variable: `fbi$Year <- factor(fbi$Year)`

- Compare summary of Year to the previous result

- Are there other variables that should be factors (or vice versa)?

# Note: factors in boxplots

boxplots in ggplot2 only work properly if the x variable is a character variable or a factor:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message= FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(classdata)
```

```{r}
twoyear <- dplyr::filter(fbi, Year %in% c(1961, 2016))
```

.pull-left[
```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height = 3, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = twoyear, 
       aes(x = Year, 
           y = Count)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height = 3, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = twoyear, 
       aes(x = factor(Year), 
           y = Count)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
]

# Data types: checking and casting

Checking for, and casting between types: 

- `str`, `mode` provide info on type

- `is.XXX` (with XXX either `factor, int, numeric, logical, character, ...` ) checks for specific type

- `as.XXX` casts to specific type

---

# Casting between types

![](images/casting.png)

**Note:** `as.numeric` applied to a factor retrieves *order* of labels, not labels, even if those could be interpreted as numbers.

To get the labels of a factor as numbers, first cast to character and then to a number.

# Levels of factor variables

- `levels(x)` shows us the levels of factor variable `x` in their current order

- factor variables often have to be re-ordered for ease of comparisons

- We can specify the order of the levels by explicitly listing them, see `help(factor)`

- We can make the order of the levels in one variable dependent on the summary statistic of another variable


---

# Reordering factor levels - manual

```{r}
levels(fbi$Type)
```

manually (extremely sensitive to typos):

```{r}
levels(factor(fbi$Type, levels=c("Larceny.theft", "Burglary", "Motor.vehicle.theft", "Aggravated.assault", "Robbery", "Legacy.rape", "Murder.and.nonnegligent.Manslaughter", "Rape")))
```

---

# Reordering factor levels - using another variable

`reorder(factor, numbers, function)`

reorder levels in factor by values in `numbers`. Use `function` to summarise (average is used by default). 

```{r}
levels(reorder(fbi$Type, fbi$Count, na.rm=TRUE))
```

missing values in `numbers`? make sure to use parameter `na.rm=TRUE`!

## Your turn 


For this your turn use the `fbi` object from the `classdata` package. 

- Introduce a rate of the number of reported offenses by population into the `fbi` data. You could use the *Ames standard* to make values comparable to a city of the size of Ames and Story county (population ~100,000).

- Plot boxplots of crime rates by different types of crime. How can you make axis text legible? 

- Reorder the boxplots of crime rates, such that the boxplots are ordered by their medians. 

- For one type of crime (subset!) plot boxplots of rates by state, reorder boxplots by median crime rates


---

# Changing Levels' names

```{r}
levels(fbi$Type)
```

```{r}
levels(fbi$Type)[6] <- "Murder"

levels(fbi$Type)
```
