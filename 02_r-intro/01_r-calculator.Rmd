# Outline

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)
```


- R is a calculator

- five commands to look at objects

- extracting pieces

- a first glimpse at data

---

## The R language

- Learning a new language: grammar, vocabulary

- Loading, examining, summarizing data

- Creating data

- Getting help

- Miscellaneous useful stuff

class: inverse, center

## Grammar

- Basic algebra is the same as calculator/mathematics

- explicit operators: `2*x` not `2x`,  `2^p` instead of `2p`

- Applying a function is similar 

- Making a variable, use `<-` or `=`

- Everything in R is a vector

## Examples

| Math   | Type          | Code           | 
|:--- |:-------------:|-------------:|
|  $$x = \frac{2}{3}$$ | Assignments      | `x <- 2/3` |
| $$\sqrt{x}$$ | Functions  | `sqrt(x)` |
| $$y = \left( \begin{array}{c} 1\\4\\5\\2\end{array}\right)$$ | Vectors  | `y <- c(1, 4, 5, 2) ` |
| $$y_2$$ | Indices | `y[2]`| 

---

## More Examples

| Math   | Type          | Code           | 
|:--- |:-------------:|-------------:|
| $$\sum_{i=1}^{4} y_i$$ | Mathematical Operators | `sum(y)` |
| $$2y$$ |  | `2*y` |

---
class: inverse

## Your Turn (5 min) 


- Introduce vector $x$ defined as $$x = \left( \begin{array}{c} 4\\1\\3\\9\end{array}\right)$$

- Introduce vector $y$ defined as  $$y = \left( \begin{array}{c} 1\\2\\3\\5\end{array}\right)$$


- Calculate the Euclidean distance between the two vectors $x$ and $y$, defined as 

$$d = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^4 (x_i - y_i)^2}$$

---

## Vocabulary 

- What verbs (=functions) do you need to know?

- Loading data

- Accessing parts of things

- Statistical summaries

- ...

---

## R Reference Card

- Download the R Reference Card from http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf

- Open/Print it so that you can glance at it while working




---

### Getting help within R

If you want to know what a specific `command` is doing:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?command

help("command") 

help.search("command")

??command
```

<br>

### Getting out

```{r, eval = FALSE}
q()
```

Quits out of the console


---

## Loading class data

- Some R packages have in-built datasets

- For this class, there is an R package available on github 

- Installing/Updating `classdata` package (once every so often):
```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("heike/classdata")
```

- Make the data available (every time you start R):
```{r}
library(classdata)
```


---
class: inverse
## Your Turn (5 min) 


- Install the package `classdata` on your machine <br>

- Make the package active in your current R session:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(classdata)
```

- Check the R help on the dataset `fbi`<br>

- What happens if you just type in the name of the dataset?


---

## Inspecting objects

for object `x`, we can try out the following commands:

- `x`

- `head(x)`

- `summary(x)`

- `str(x)`

- `dim(x)`

<br><br><br>

<font color="darkblue">Try these commands out for yourself on the `fbi` data.</font>


---

## `str` stands for *structure*

- `str` shows us the **str**ucture of an object

- fbi is a data frame with columns (variables) and rows (records)

```{r}
str(fbi)
```

---

## Extracting parts of objects

For object `x`, we can extract parts in the following manner:

```
x$variable
x[, "variable"]

x[rows, columns]
x[1:5, 2:3]
x[c(1,5,6), c("State","Year")]

x$variable[rows]
```
`rows` and `columns` are vectors of indices.

<br><br><br>

<font color="darkblue">Try these commands out for yourself on the `fbi` data.</font>

---

## Statistical summaries

Elements of the five point summary: <br>
`mean, median, min, max, quartiles`

Other summary statistics:<br>
`range, sd, var`

Summaries of two variables:<br>
`cor, cov`


---
class: inverse
## Your turn 


- Look at the first 10 data records of the `fbi` data

- Compute mean and standard deviation for the number of counts. Why do you get NAs? (read `?NA`)

- Advanced:  Read `?mean` and `?sd`, and fix missing value problem


---
class: inverse 
## Your turn - practice to ask questions 


Write down questions that you could answer with this data 4 minutes by yourself, then pair up for another 3 minutes, and we'll write ideas on the board
