Among all the available definitions of weed, I would use ""a plant out of place"" to define it. I expect that the extension documents are written in a neutral tone. From time to time, I saw documents that refer to weeds as human enemies, which offers a sense of negativity. I'd like to see if the extension documents are neutral-tone, and if they are not, how to visualize the results in the most eye-catchy way. 
I understand that finding enough data and compiling them into a workable dataset would be very time-consuming. So my next question is how to do this data collection and wrangling the most effectively and efficiently. ","2020-08-17 18:58:03","public","","","173.24.204.89","1","1"
