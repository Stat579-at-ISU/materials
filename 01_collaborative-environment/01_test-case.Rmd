## One last thing ...

### Imagine the following situation: 

it's your last day before you go on your summer vacation after a stressful stretch of work. 
The last two weeks were filled with deadline after deadline for all of your projects. 

--


You are planning to leave in a couple of minutes. 

--

Your boss storms in ... "I'm glad I still caught you, I need to know, what the average weight of Iowans was in 2015. We have three different numbers and I know which one is the right one."

Before you can explain that you won't be here for the next couple of weeks, she is gone.

--


Two minutes later you get a text with two links:

"Don't forget to put in a blurb about how you got the number and stuff"

- [Codebook](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2015/pdf/codebook15_llcp.pdf)

## How bad can it be?

- You confidently download the data in your favorite analysis software (this does not have to be R!)

- and take a look at the data.

<!--
## A test case

The dataset `brfss_iowa.csv` (linked from website) contains 6227 records from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for Iowans.

> The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nation's premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors.

It is conducted annually by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Codebook with detailed explanations of variables is [available here](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2015/pdf/codebook15_llcp.pdf).

## Your turn

Prompt:

> I need to know, what the average weight of Iowans was in 2015."

> Don't forget to put in a blurb about how you got your number

In the next 5 mins:

--

1. Work on this problem

--

2. When the alarm rings, save your work, go to Canvas and answer the survey "a dispute". 

<!--
0. Complete the following tasks and **write instructions / documentation** for a collaborator to be able to reproduce your findings.

1. Verify that there are 6227 cases (= number of interviews) in the data. 

2. Verify that there are variables `WEIGHT2` and `HEIGHT3` in the data and read the description of the variables in the codebook. 

3. How are height and weight related? Find correlations of weight and height by gender (`SEX`). How many values are the correlations based on for each gender?

2. Write a short report of your findings. Address potential problems in the data.
