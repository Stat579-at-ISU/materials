# Tools for collaborating in teams


## A test case

This is a two-part exercise:

**Part 1:** Analyze + document

**Part 2:** Swap + discuss


## Part 1: Analyze + document

Introduce yourself to your neighbor. Solve the following problem as a team.

Assume you are a team within a larger project (i.e. keep your collaborators in mind). 

Complete the following tasks and **write instructions / documentation** for your
collaborator to reproduce your work starting with the original dataset 
([`data/gapminder-5060.csv`](data/gapminder-5060.csv) or [`data/gapminder-5060.xlsx`](data/gapminder-5060.xlsx)).



## Your turn: analyze + document (20 mins) {.white}

1. <font color="white">Visualize life expectancy over time for Canada in the 1950s and 1960s using a line plot.</font>
2. <font color="white">Something is clearly wrong with this plot! Turns out there's a data error 
in the data file: life expectancy for Canada in the year 1957 is coded
as `999999`, it should actually be `69.96`. Make this correction.</font>
3. <font color="white">Visualize life expectancy over time for Canada again, with the corrected data.</font><br>

<font color="white">*Pro goal:* Add lines for Mexico and the United States.</font>
</p>

## Part 2: swap + discuss (20 mins) {.white}

<img src="images/blue.jpeg" class="cover" height=1500>

<font color="white">Introduce yourself to the team closest to you.</font>

1. <font color="white">Swap instructions / documentation with the other team, and try to reproduce 
their work, first **without talking to each oher**. </font>

<font color="white">If your collaborator does not have/know the software they need to reproduce your work,  walk them through it on your computer 
in a way that would emulate the experience. (Remember, this could be part of the
irreproducibility problem!)</font>

2. <font color="white">Then, talk to each other about challenges you faced (or didn't face) or why 
you were or weren't able to reproduce their work.</font>

## How did that go?

- Where did things get problematic?


## Reflection

- Were you successful in reproducing each others' work? 
- What tools did you use?
<br><br>
- What would happen if your collaborator is no longer available to walk you through 
their analysis?
- What made it easy / hard for reproducing your partners' work?
- What would have to happen if 
    - you had to swap out the dataset or extend the analysis further?
    - you caught further data errors and had to re-create the analysis
    with corrections?
    - you had to revert back to the original dataset?

## Summary

- Everyone struggles with reproducibility and it is a hindrance to moving 
science forward
- Even with a fairly simple analysis challenges were faced in four main areas:
organization, documentation, automation, and dissemination
