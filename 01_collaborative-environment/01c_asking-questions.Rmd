## Asking a good question

- What are you working on/trying to do?

- What problem have you run into (error message in case it is R)

- What have you done to try to fix the problem?


Try to explain your rubber duck what is going wrong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging#cite_note-4).

## Asking a good question

is a learned and valuable skill! 

Have a look at:

- stackoverflow's [Asking a good question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)

- R's [Posting guidelines](https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html)

## First aid for help

There's lots of ways to get help in case you are stuck:

1. Google is your friend! in particular, stackoverflow and R help are usually great resources,

2. ask a team member,

3. write email to the instructor with your question, but please avoid any [lmgtfy](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=What+does+lmgtfy+mean?) questions!
