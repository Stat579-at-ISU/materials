# Messy (4)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Messy (4)

Messy (4): *Values for a single observational unit are stored across multiple tables.*

After data are normalized by splitting, we want to de-normalize again by *joining* datasets.

---

# Example: Lahman package

Sean Lahman is a database journalist, who started databases of historical sports statistics, in particular, the Lahman database on baseball.

```{r}
library(Lahman)
LahmanData
```

---

# Lahman database

The Lahman database consists of 24 data frames that are linked by `playerID`. <br>
This is clean, but not very readable. <br>
The `Master` table includes names and other attributes for each player. <br>
*Joining* multiple tables helps us to bring together (pieces of) information from multiple sources.

# Example: Hall of Fame

Who was inducted in the Hall of Fame in 2017?

```{r warning = FALSE, fig.height = 3.5}
HallOfFame %>% filter(yearID==2017) 
```

# Your turn 


For this your turn use the `HallOfFame` and `Master` data from the `Lahman` package 

- Identify all players who were inducted in the Hall of Fame in 2017, by filtering the `Master` data for their player IDs.

# Joins - general idea

![](images/join.png)

---

# Joins - more specific idea

- Data sets are joined along values of variables. 

- In `dplyr` there are several join functions: `left_join`, `inner_join`, `full_join`, ...

- Differences between join functions only visible, if not all values in one set have values in the other


---


```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(id = 1:6, trt = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), rep=c(2,1,3)), value = c(5,3,7,1,2,3))
df1
```

```{r}
df2 <- data.frame(id=c(4,4,5,5,7,7), stress=rep(c(0,1), 3), bpm = c(65, 125, 74, 136, 48, 110))
df2
```    

---

# Left join

- all elements in the *left* data set are kept

- non-matches are filled in by `NA`

- `right_join` works symmetric

```{r}
left_join(df1, df2, by="id")
```

---

# Inner join

- only matches from both data sets are kept

```{r}
inner_join(df1, df2, by = "id")
```

---

# Full join

- all ids are kept, missings are filled in with `NA`

```{r}
full_join(df1, df2, by = "id")
```

# Your turn (10 mins)


- Load the `Lahman` package into your R session.

- Join (relevant pieces of) the `Master` data set and the `HallOfFame` data.

- Find all Hall of Famers who were alive as of 2017.

- How many attempts at being inducted to the HoF does Sammy Sosa have already?


---

# Traps of joins

- sometimes we unexpectedly cannot match values: missing values, different spelling, ... 

- join can be along multiple variables, e.g. `by = c("ID", "Date")`

- joining variable(s) can have different names, e.g. `by = c("State" = "Name")`

- always make sure to check dimensions of data before and after a join

- check on missing values; help with that: `anti_join`

---

# Anti join

- a neat function in `dplyr`

- careful, not symmetric!  

```{r}
anti_join(df1, df2, by="id") # no values for id in df2
anti_join(df2, df1, by="id") # no values for id in df1
```

# Your turn (10 mins) 

For this example, use the data from the `classdata` package

- Load the `classdata` package into your R session.

- Investigate data sets `box` and `budget`.

- Join the two datasets to incorporate the release date of movies into the box office gross.

- Check on the dimensions of the data sets before and after the join. Where are potential problems?

- Use `anti_join` to detect problematic cases.
